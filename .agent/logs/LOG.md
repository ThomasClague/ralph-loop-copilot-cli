## 2026-02-28 — TASK-4: Create and apply Drizzle migration

- Added `fs.mkdirSync('./data', { recursive: true })` to `migrate.ts` for fresh-machine safety
- Added auto-migration call in `index.ts` using `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3/migrator`
- Migration SQL file already existed from TASK-3 in `drizzle/0000_flat_silver_samurai.sql`
- Ran `npm run db:migrate` — created `data/prospectforge.db` with all 5 tables: batches, media, prospects, sent_emails, settings
- Verified tables via Python sqlite3 query

---

## 2026-02-28 — TASK-3: Define database schema for all tables

- Defined all 5 tables in `next-app/src/db/schema.ts`: `batches`, `prospects`, `media`, `sentEmails`, `settings`
- `prospects.slug` has unique constraint; `status` defaults to `'pending'`
- All JSON blob fields stored as `text`; FK references properly set
- Ran `drizzle-kit generate` → produced `drizzle/0000_flat_silver_samurai.sql` with all 5 CREATE TABLE statements
- TypeScript compiles without errors


- Created `next-app/src/db/index.ts` with Drizzle client connected to `./data/prospectforge.db`
- Created `next-app/src/db/schema.ts` (placeholder, expanded in TASK-3)
- Created `next-app/src/db/migrate.ts` migration runner
- Created `next-app/drizzle.config.ts` with sqlite dialect config
- Added `data/` and `data/*.db` to `.gitignore`
- Added `db:migrate` script to `package.json`
- TypeScript compiles without errors; unit tests pass
